# Happy Thoughts

Create a site that is similar to Twitter with Happy Thoughts by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

I started with checking out the API on the site Postman to see what information I get and what happens when posting a thought and so on. Then later sketched what component I will need and what will do what. To later make the component and fetching the information.
